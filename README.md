# Sentiment Aware Summary Generation

## Problem Statement
In todayâ€™s fast-paced world, we strive to consume as much information as possible without regard to the emotional content it carries. We try to save time using text summarization on various informational content such as news sources, articles, Twitter posts, and Reddit posts. However, this summarized content may not be sentimentally consistent with the source text. This mismatch in sentiment can lead to information not being communicated in the most effective way possible and may also not have the same emotional impact as the original article.  

## Dataset
We will be using the CNN/Daily Mail dataset to create a text summarization task model. This dataset consists of News Articles and their Summaries. It has 287,113 articles in the training set, 13,368 in the validation, and 11,490 in the testing set.

We will manually generate the text classification dataset for sentiment analysis from the CNN/Daily Mail dataset.


## Proposed Solution
We will be working with various state of the art language models such as BERT, BART, XLNet, and RoBerta to propose a summary and a Sentiment score for the article. We plan on introducing a Sentiment Consistency Loss, which will ensure that the summary and article have the same sentimental impact. We will evaluate the generated summary using ROGUE and the percentage difference in sentiment scores of the Original article and generated summary.

We threw stones at policemen. We threw stones at citizens. We created camera-ready chaos, and we replayed the images.
